Meme Generator

### Description 

This simple app built with React, HTML5 and CSS allows you to generate a random meme image via https://api.imgflip.com/ and overlay top and bottom text of the users choice, creating a unique, custom meme. 
Although a fun app, it can help the user brainstorm new meme slogans with images they would have otherwise not thought of.
